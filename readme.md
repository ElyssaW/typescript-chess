# Typescript Chess

Just a little implementation of Chess in Typescript. I'm starting with a basic implementation of the rules, then progressing onto more finicky edge cases like "The pawn can go double on it's first move" and "Switch the king with the castle."

## To-Do

- [x] Initialize board
- [ ] Create classes for each piece
- [ ] Set starting board state
- [ ] Set turn system
- [ ] Set "selected piece" mechanic, so players can move their pieces
- [ ] Create function to look for Check state
- [ ] Create function to look for Checkmate state
