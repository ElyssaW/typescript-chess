# Typescript Chess

Just a little implementation of Chess in Typescript. I'm starting with a basic implementation of the rules, then progressing onto more finicky edge cases like "The pawn can go double on it's first move" and "Switch the king with the castle."

## To-Do

- [x] Initialize board
- [x] Create classes for each piece
- [x] Set starting board state
- [x] Set turn system
- [x] Set "selected piece" mechanic, so players can move their pieces
- [x] Create function to look for Check state
- [ ] Create function to look for Checkmate state
